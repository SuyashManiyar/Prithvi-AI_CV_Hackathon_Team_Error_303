Important Note:

The files that start with the name Experimental are colab files for various Experimental Models used like SVM,CNN etc that performed great in Training data but gave uninspiring results in Testing data and are only added for the prpose of comparision.

The Problem Statement-Detecting if a defect exists or not in a fabric cloth piece and Drawing a bounding boxes around the defects in the defected cloth piece.

The file [https://github.com/SuyashManiyar/Prithvi-AI_CV_Hackathon_Team_Error_303/blob/main/image_optimization.ipynb](image_optimization) is used to combat the problem of losing information upon reducing the resolution of the image and for that purpose  AntiAliasing technique was used .


The most important files to be looked at is [https://github.com/SuyashManiyar/Prithvi-AI_CV_Hackathon_Team_Error_303/blob/main/BoundingBox_Final.ipynb](BoundingBox_Final)because this file consists of the actual code using which the Final Bounding Box coordinates were calculated .

And the other important file using which The Classification was done is [https://github.com/SuyashManiyar/Prithvi-AI_CV_Hackathon_Team_Error_303/blob/main/Classification_Final.ipynb](Classification_Final).
