# Prithvi-AI_CV_Hackathon_Team_Error_303
This Repository is a part of Submission of a Hackathon by Prithvi AI
The Problem Statement-Detecting if a defect exists or not in a fabric cloth piece and Drawing a bounding boxes around the defects in the defected cloth piece
The file https://github.com/SuyashManiyar/Prithvi-AI_CV_Hackathon_Team_Error_303/blob/main/image_optimization.ipynb is used to combat the problem of losing information upon reducing the resolution of the image and for that purpose  AntiAliasing technique was used .
The files that start with the name Experimental are colab files for various Experimental Models used like SVM,CNN etc that performed great in Training data but gave uninspiring results in Testing data and are only added for the prpose of comparision.
The most important files to be looked at is https://github.com/SuyashManiyar/Prithvi-AI_CV_Hackathon_Team_Error_303/blob/main/defect_box_iteration2.ipynb because this file consists of the actual code using which the Final Bounding Box coordinates were calculated .
